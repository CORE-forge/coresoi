What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00

## CORE ecosystem

`coresoi` is part of of the project CO.R.E.- Corruption risk indicators
in emergency, financed by the EU Commission, as part of the Internal
Police Security Fund (ISF-P) program, The project presented by the
Department of Political Sciences as leader with the coordination of
Prof. Gnaldi (PI) was funded for a total of 514 thousand euros. The
working group is made up of colleagues Prof. Enrico Carloni, Prof. Marco
Mazzoni, Prof. Benedetto Ponti, Prof. Maria Giovanna Ranalli. The
international network involves Universitat Obierta Catalunya (Spain),
Dublin City University (Ireland), Oficina Antifrau de Catalunya (Spain),
Infonodes (Italy), Transparency International (Portugal), Villa Montesca
Foundation (Italy). The C.R.E. focuses on assessing the risk of
corruption in public procurement from a preventive perspective. In view
of achieving this goal, central to the European agenda, CO.R.E. it
therefore intends to develop and validate a procedure for constructing a
synthetic indicator of the risk of corruption in an emergency period
that can be usefully used by national anti-corruption agencies, the
media and citizens for accountability purposes.
