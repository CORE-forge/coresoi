<p>The objective of this summary is to synthesize the methodological
choices taken within the CO.R.E project to the final aim of validating
the statistical procedure to develop a composite indicator of corruption
risk in public procurement in emergency.</p>
<p>A major challenge in the measurement of complex and latent phenomena
such as corruption and corruption risks consists in summarising
information available from a set of single indicators (i.e. red flags)
into a single metrics, such as a Composite Indicator (CI) of corruption
risk. CIs are a useful communication tool for conveying summary
information in a relatively simple way. They are used widely in various
sectors in public services as tools in policy analysis and public
communication to compare units of analysis (Countries, regions,
contracting bodies etc.). Constructing a CI is a difficult task and full
of pitfalls: from the obstacles regarding the availability of data and
the choice of the individual indicators to their normalization,
aggregation, weighting and validity check. Currently, both at the
academic and the policy level, little energies have been devoted to
developing a robust synthetic/composite indicator of corruption risk in
public procurement, as an aggregated measure of single red flags. Among
them, the proposal of Fazekas and colleagues (Fazekas et al., 2016)
stands out. In this work, the authors develop a composite score of
tendering red flags, the Corruption Risk Index (CRI), as a proxy measure
of high-level corruption in public procurement, derived from public
procurement data from 28 European countries for 2009-2014. A similar
study is carried out by Troìa (Troìa, 2020) with data and red flag
indicators developed from the Italian National Dataset of Public
Contracts (Banca Dati Nazionale dei Contratti Pubblici). Further, in the
Single Market scoreboard Initiative, the single indicators (i.e., red
flags) are aggregated by summing them to show how different EU countries
are performing on key aspects of public procurement. Composite
indicators of corruption risk in public procurement developed currently
by researchers and experts are based on a selection of most common
elementary indicators or red flags of corruption risk and rely on a
rather simple methodological base. On one hand, common red flags need to
be re-thought to be effective in assessing corruption risk in public
procurement over crises. As known, red flag indicators may suffer from
overestimating corruption risks, because there can be non-corrupt
instances where red flag indicators signal risk, giving rise to false
positives. This main drawback of red flags is amplified over crises. The
crisis introduced by the Covid-19, for example, taught us that public
procurement systems react to emergency situations through the adoption
of relaxed regulatory frameworks. Under these latest contexts, relying
on common red flags (such as those accounting for the proportion of bids
adopted through an exceptional procedure and/or very rapid bidding
procedures) is likely to lead us to overestimate corruption risks, as
high values for these elementary indicators may mirror legitimate
procedural choices allowed by a relaxed regulatory framework rather (or
other) than an actual high level of corruption. On the other hand,
actual composite indicators of corruption risk are obtained as a simple
un-weighted arithmetic mean or sum of individual risk indicators.
Summation reflects the view that different combinations of elementary
corruption techniques can equally identify a contract as corrupt.
However, as sophisticated actors can achieve corrupt control of a tender
even with the recourse to a single corruption technique, CIs obtained as
a simple mean or sum of elementary indicators represent only a lower
bound estimate of corruption risk. This is an important source of
limitation of current CIs, as the same proposing Authors (Fazekas et
al., 2016) suggest. Besides, current proposals rely on linear
aggregation methods, which are just one among many possible choices with
different methodological and substantial justifications and different
application potential. For instance, linear aggregation methods are
worthwhile when all single indicators have the same measurement unit,
but geometric aggregations are better suited if some degree of
non-compensability between individual indicators or dimensions is
required. Furthermore, the current literature lacks a validation
procedure of the proposed composite, reporting a sensitivity analysis of
the composite indicator with the aim of verifying its robustness.</p>
<p>Validating a statistical procedure to develop a composite indicator
of corruption risk in public procurement in emergency is a complex task
involving several stages: i. data selection ii. selection of elementary
indicators (i.e. red flags of corruption risk); iii. normalisation
methods; iv. weighting and aggregation schemes; v. Multivariate analysis
for the study of the data structure; vi. Sensitivity analysis.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Data selection and architecture</strong>: A solid data
infrastructure is utterly important to be able to deal with massive
amount of information and with their usual characteristics such as the 3
Vs in big data, i.e. Volume, Velocity and Variety. To this aim, the
CO.R.E. project exploits both opensource software and cloud
infrastructure to be able to deal with big data in emergency scenarios,
where the Q standing for Quickness is an essential component. By doing
so, we develop a data pipeline, extracting data from the official open
source data portal from ANAC (both for cigs, i.e. traditional tenders
and smartcigs, simplified tenders), then we rehydrate its data with
L190/2012 and proprietary, confidential and tremendously informative
data coming from reliable sources. In the end, we calculate indicators
whose results are going to be stored in a further space with the purpose
of distributing them to the frontend i.e. the CO.R.E.
dashboard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Choice of elementary indicators</strong>: Companies and
contracting authorities at risk of being corrupt across crises are
identified through a set of red flags only in part derived by the
current literature and computed through a novel procedure which exploits
the time discontinuity introduced by a crisis outbreak and the
possibility to distinguish two time-spans, a pre-crisis and a
post-crisis period. The approach compares, whenever possible, company
and/or contracting authority behaviours after the crisis outbreak with
respect to their historical behaviour and assesses the associated risk
through statistical testing. The proposed procedure is extensible to
other crisis contexts, replicable to other national contexts, and
adjustable on account of different market trends across the various
crises.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Normalisation methods</strong>: Normalisation has the aim
of taking all individual indicators to the same scale and to the same
(usually positive) polarity. To this end, several methods can be
employed such as standardisation, categorization, rescaling, ranking,
and indexing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weighting and aggregation schemes</strong>: Once single
indicators are normalised, they need to be combined to obtain the CI. To
this end, a weighting system and an aggregation scheme should be chosen.
The former implies the scale of importance of each individual indicator,
while the latter identifies the technique (compensatory, partially
compensatory or non-compensatory) for summarising the individual
indicator values into a single number. We briefly review the most
relevant alternatives and combinations thereof available from the
literature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multivariate analysis for the study of the data
structure</strong>: The CI of corruption risk is the result of a
transformation of available red flags in a unique measure. However,
different dimensions (represented by groups of red flags) might be
realistic, which characterise the phenomenon at issue from different
perspectives. Several statistical tools available in literature for the
dimensionality assessment of a set of elementary indicators are
therefore presented.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitivity analysis</strong> The choice of a
normalisation method, of a weighting and an aggregation scheme does have
consequences on the final value of the CI and, therefore, on the final
ranking of units with respect to corruption risk in public procurement
in emergency. To this end, a sensitivity analysis needs to be undertaken
to assess the robustness of the CI in terms of the mechanism for
including or excluding single indicators, the normalisation method, the
choice of weighting and aggregation scheme.s</p></li>
