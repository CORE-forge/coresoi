<p>The strengths and weaknesses of composite indicators (CIs) largely
derive from the quality of the underlying elementary indicators, which
in our context are the red flags of corruption risk in public
procurement. Red flag indicators are at the core of corruption risk
assessment systems developed to identify corruption risks and settle
effective strategies for mitigating them in a preventative logic. They
are proxy measures for corruption, signalling risks of corruption,
rather than actual corruption. Red flags are then expected to be
correlated with corrupt practices, rather than perfectly matching them
(OECD 2019; Fazekas and Kocsis 2020).</p>
<p>Typically, corruption in public procurement aims at steering the
contract to the favoured bidder without detection, in an
institutionalised and recurrent fashion. Indeed, institutionalised grand
corruption aims primarily at extracting rents. In public procurement,
rents can be gained by pre-selecting companies, which then receive extra
profit by charging higher than average market prices for the contract
object delivery (Abdou et al. 2021). To assess corruption risks by
quantifying extra-profit, researchers and policy makers would need data
on price and quantity of procured deliveries, which are usually
available in most public procurement administrative datasets, but
incomparable across time and space. Thus, complementary proxies of
corruption risk are proposed, such as the circumstance that a
procurement procedure receives a single offer by a single bidder.
Indeed, the number of bids submitted, especially when there is only one
submitted bid, has been shown to be associated with corruption risks
(Klasnja 2015) and extensively adopted in the literature as a proxy of
corruption. Other recurrent risk indicators are (Fazekas and Kocsis
2020): absence of publication of the call for tenders (when the
publication is voluntary); non-open or exceptional procedure types
(Auriol, Straub, and Flochel 2016), such as direct awards, which allow
to stifle competition and steer contracts to the selected bidders; too
short advertisement time-periods, which can inhibit non-connected
bidders to develop adequate bids in time; subjective and
hard-to-quantify evaluation criteria (in place of price-related
criteria), which imply certain discretionary margins and may limit
accountability control mechanisms; too short time intervals to award
contracts, as snap decisions may imply premediated appraisal.</p>
<p>Such proxy indicators are typically obtained by accounting for the
degree of unjustified restriction of competition in the public
procurement process (Fazekas, Toth, and King 2016; Fazekas, Cingolani,
and Toth 2016, 2018). They operationalise the corruption definition
according to which corruption works when the principles of open and fair
competition are circumvented by public officials, in order to
recurrently award public contracts to connected companies (Fazekas and
Kocsis 2020). The above corruption red flags signal corruption only if
competition is expected in the absence of corruption (Fazekas and Kocsis
2020). Hence, they cannot be effectively employed when markets are under
non-competitive circumstances. Further, and most importantly, under the
relaxed public procurement control systems introduced by crises such as
the Covid-19 emergency, many of the bids receive a single offer and are
adopted through exceptional and very rapid procedures, in order to
supply shortages of essential goods. Relying on the above-mentioned red
flags under crises would then likely lead us to overestimate corruption
risks and to give rise to false positives, as high values are likely to
mirror legitimate procedural choices allowed by a relaxed regulatory
framework rather (or other) than an actual high level of corruption.
Indeed, red flag indicators may suffer from overestimating corruption
risks, as there can be non-corrupt instances where red flag indicators
signal risk, giving rise to false positives (OECD 2019). In both normal
and exceptional circumstances, the distorting effect of false positives
can be attenuated by carefully selecting the elementary risk indicators
that are most closely associated with other corruption risk signals.</p>
<p>Given the premises above, in the CO.R.E. project we propose to
identify companies and contracting authorities which may be at risk of
being corrupt across crises, through the selection of a set of red
flags, only in part derived by the current literature, but computed
through a novel procedure which exploits the time discontinuity
introduced by crisis outbreak, that is, the possibility to distinguish
two time-spans, a pre-crisis period and a post-crisis period.
Specifically, as it will be further clarified in the next sections, the
approach compares, whenever possible, company and/or contracting
authority behaviours after the emergency outbreak with respect to their
historical behaviour and assesses the associated risk through
statistical testing. Given the focus on crisis scenarios, each red flag
will be calculated regarding contracts awarded in the relevant market
for the crisis at issue (i.e., the health market classified with the
Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) 33 for the Covid-19 crisis).</p>
<p>The proposed procedure is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>extensible</em> to other crisis contexts to assess the risk of
corruption in public procurement by i. setting the two time-spams in
accordance with the entry date of the legislative act acknowledging the
beginning of the emergency period; ii. selecting the relevant contracts
objects (i.e., CPV), depending on the pertinent markets most concerned
with the specific crisis at hand;</li>
<li>
<em>replicable</em> to other national contexts where the data needed
for the red flag calculation are available;</li>
<li>
<em>adjustable</em> on account of market trends across the crisis,
by setting the statistical test hypotheses accordingly.</li>
