`coresoi` is a product of the project CO.R.E.- Corruption risk indicators in emergency, financed by the EU Commission, as part of the Internal Police Security Fund (ISF-P) program.

The goal of `coresoi` is to provide a _sandbox_ environment for researchers and anti-corruption analysts to interact with the indicators of corruption risk in public procurement over emergencies we‚Äôve designed. We also offer mock data extracted from [dati.anticorruzione](https://dati.anticorruzione.it/index.html#/home) to aid in their analysis. Our hope is that this platform will promote greater transparency in government, by helping researchers and anti-corruption analysts to make their efforts in fighting corruption more effective.

## Installation

You can install the development version of coresoi from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CORE-forge/coresoi")
```

## CORE ecosystem üåè

`coresoi` is part of the project __CO.R.E.__ - Corruption Risk indicators in Emergency, financed by the EU Commission, as part of the Internal Police Security Fund (ISF-P) program. The project presented by the Department of Political Sciences of the University of Perugia (Italy) as leader with the coordination of Prof.¬†Gnaldi (PI) was funded for a total of 514 thousand euros. The international network involves Universitat Obierta Catalunya ( __Spain__ ), Dublin City University ( __Ireland__), Oficina Antifrau de Catalunya ( __Spain__), Infonodes ( __Italy__), Transparency International ( __Portugal__), Villa Montesca Foundation ( __Italy__). 
CO.R.E. focuses on assessing the risk of corruption in public procurement in emergency settings from a preventive point of view. In view of achieving this goal, central to the European agenda, CO.R.E. intends to develop and validate a replicable procedure for the construction of a synthetic (or composite) indicator (CI) of the risk of corruption in public procurement in various emergency scenarios, which can be usefully employed by national anti-corruption agencies, the media and the citizens for accountability purposes. 

The development of a synthetic measure of corruption risk involves several stages:
 
1. selection of the data 
1. computation of elementary indicators (i.e. red flags) of corruption risk; 
1. choice of normalization, weighting and aggregation schemes;
1. multivariate analysis for the study of the data relational structure;
1. sensitivity analysis of the resulting synthetic indicator to check its robustness. 

For each of these steps, `coresoi` provides a support to any interested user through analytical codes, users‚Äô guides and practical examples.
