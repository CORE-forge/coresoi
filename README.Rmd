The goal of `coresoi` is to provide a _sandbox_ environment for researchers and anti-corruption analysts to interact with the indicators we've designed. We also offer mock data extracted from [dati.anticorruzione](https://dati.anticorruzione.it/index.html#/home) to aid in their analysis. Our hope is that this platform will facilitate more effective efforts against corruption and promote greater transparency in government.

## Installation

You can install the development version of coresoi from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CORE-forge/coresoi")
```

## Example: Compute Winning rate across the crisis indicator

In certain cases, it may be necessary to calculate Indicator 1, which primarily focuses on companies that were awarded public contracts at a significantly higher rate after the outbreak of the Emergency (in this case, the Coronavirus) than before. Indicator 1 uses a [Fisher's exact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test) (other test choices include [Barnard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_test)  and [z-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test)) test to compare the proportions of pre- and post-Emergency contracts and determine if there is any statistically significant difference between the two groups.

The resulting indicator follows a schema (which is convenient to ship to frontends) that is generated using the `coresoi::generate_indicator_schema` function.

```{r example}
library(coresoi)
library(dplyr)

## basic example code with ind_1() i.e. High Winning Rate
ind_1_res <- ind_1(
  data = mock_data_core, 
  publication_date = data_pubblicazione, 
  stat_unit = cf_amministrazione_appaltante,
  emergency_name = "coronavirus",
  test_type = "fisher")
ind_1_res
```


## CORE ecosystem 🌏

`coresoi` is part of of the project CO.R.E.- Corruption risk indicators in emergency, financed by the EU Commission, as part of the Internal Police Security Fund (ISF-P) program,
The project presented by the Department of Political Sciences as leader with the coordination of Prof. Gnaldi (PI) was funded for a total of 514 thousand euros. The working group is made up of colleagues Prof. Enrico Carloni, Prof. Marco Mazzoni, Prof. Benedetto Ponti, Prof. Maria Giovanna Ranalli. The international network involves Universitat Obierta Catalunya (Spain), Dublin City University (Ireland), Oficina Antifrau de Catalunya (Spain), Infonodes (Italy), Transparency International (Portugal), Villa Montesca Foundation (Italy).
The C.R.E. focuses on assessing the risk of corruption in public procurement from a preventive perspective. In view of achieving this goal, central to the European agenda, CO.R.E. it therefore intends to develop and validate a procedure for constructing a synthetic indicator of the risk of corruption in an emergency period that can be usefully used by national anti-corruption agencies, the media and citizens for accountability purposes.


## 📝 TODOs
