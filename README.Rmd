## Installation

You can install the development version of core-soi from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CORE-forge/core-soi")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(coresoi)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## CORE ecosystem

`coresoi` is part of of the project CO.R.E.- Corruption risk indicators in emergency, financed by the EU Commission, as part of the Internal Police Security Fund (ISF-P) program,
The project presented by the Department of Political Sciences as leader with the coordination of Prof. Gnaldi (PI) was funded for a total of 514 thousand euros. The working group is made up of colleagues Prof. Enrico Carloni, Prof. Marco Mazzoni, Prof. Benedetto Ponti, Prof. Maria Giovanna Ranalli. The international network involves Universitat Obierta Catalunya (Spain), Dublin City University (Ireland), Oficina Antifrau de Catalunya (Spain), Infonodes (Italy), Transparency International (Portugal), Villa Montesca Foundation (Italy).
The C.R.E. focuses on assessing the risk of corruption in public procurement from a preventive perspective. In view of achieving this goal, central to the European agenda, CO.R.E. it therefore intends to develop and validate a procedure for constructing a synthetic indicator of the risk of corruption in an emergency period that can be usefully used by national anti-corruption agencies, the media and citizens for accountability purposes.
