\title{Get the set of weights for building the composite indicator}
\usage{
get_weights(data, method, expert_weights = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data matrix of \strong{binary} elementary indicators (without missing values).}

\item{method}{method for getting the set of weights. Possible choices are:
\code{"equal"}, \code{"experts"} or \code{"irt"}. See Details.}

\item{expert_weights}{user-provided expert weights (if any).}

\item{...}{optional arguments for \code{\link[mirt:mirt]{mirt::mirt()}} function. See Details.}
}
\value{
vector of weights.
}
\description{
\code{get_weights} returns the weights for constructing the composite indicator.
}
\details{
This function returns a vector of weights, whose dimension is equal to the
number of elementary indicators in \code{data} (say, \eqn{Q}). Three choices are offered:
\itemize{
\item \code{"equal"}: each elementary indicator receives the same weight, equal to \eqn{1/Q};
\item \code{"experts"}: each elementary indicator receives a specific weight provided by experts. The user
can provide the weights provided by his/her own experts (through argument \code{expert_weights}), otherwise
the weights provided by our pool of experts is used;
\item \code{"irt"}: each elementary indicator receives a specific weights provided by the IRT framework.
}

Specifically, a unidimensional 2PL IRT model is estimated on \code{data} through \code{\link[mirt:mirt]{mirt::mirt()}} function,
for which possible additional arguments can be provided (\code{...}), such as estimation algorithm,
numerical optimiser, convergence threshold, etc. Once the model is fitted, weights are computed
by rescaling the estimated discrimination parameters (in such a way they sum to 1).
\emph{Note: for the moment, IRT weights can be obtained only when the elementary indicators are all binary.}
